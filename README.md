I am a passionate developer currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development. With a few years of hands-on experience in technologies like Java, Android, JavaScript, and .NET, I’ve built a solid foundation of knowledge. At this point, I’m focusing on deepening my expertise in .NET and exploring game development, an area I'm excited to learn more about and apply my skills to.
