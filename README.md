I am a passionate developer currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development. With a few years of hands-on experience, I've had the opportunity to work with various technologies, including **Java, Android, JavaScript, and .NET environment**. Throughout this journey, I’ve built a solid foundation of knowledge, but my greatest passion and focus is in **mobile development**.

While I have worked with different platforms and technologies, I’ve come to realize that mobile app development is what I like to create, is where I can combine technical skills, and creativity. I believe mobility is the future of technology, and I am constantly looking to expand my understanding of the best practices, frameworks, and tools in the field.
