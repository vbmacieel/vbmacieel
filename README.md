I am a passionate developer currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development. With a few years of hands-on experience in technologies like Java, Android, JavaScript, and .NET, I’ve built a solid foundation of knowledge. At this point, I’m focusing on deepening my expertise in Java and exploring backend and Android development, areas that I'm excited to learn more about.
